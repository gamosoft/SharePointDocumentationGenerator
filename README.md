# SharePoint Documentation Generator

Ever wanted to document some components of an existing MOSS site? This tool allows you to get a listing of fields, content types, lists, features and users of a specified site.
It installs as a new feature that creates a new option under _Site Settings_ | _Site Administration_ menu called **Documentation Generator**.
The whole project was born due to a need of looking at some content types in a structured fashion, so I could see at a glance columns, types, etc...

Currently displays information in the same web page, using templates for the different elements to be documented. These templates can be modified here:

_%12HIVE%\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\SharepointDocGenerator\Templates_

Please read the migrated docs for more information until I have time to arrange the README.md file. :-)

You can download the compiled binaries here in the meantime:
